This is some of the stuff we used to ensure that there was a plan file. very cool

"""
this is a codebase that is intended to work on mac os x (a bsd kernel) but it does not work due to it using linux APIs. please analyze this codebase and make an overview of the structure and architecture and the calls that it is using and where it could fail, and write it to structure.md


based on the analysis make a plan for how you can fix this. break it into achievable tasks, add acceptance criteria for each task, and allow each task to be checked off  please write this to plan.ai.md

remember that our build environment is on linux and we are building a macos application. please analyize this situation and ensure that we have a plan written to multiplatform.ai.md. do not do anything other than analyze and write the plan to the file
